Hi! I am Shivam, a third year undergraduate studying Computer Science at BITS GoaðŸŒ´\n
This repo showcases the projects I have built so far in the following domains:

# ML/Data Science Projects
[Exercise Tracker](https://github.com/axlrpro/exercise_tracker): Uses openCV, medialib and others to detect and count various exercises.

# Information Security Projects
[File Integrity Manager](https://github.com/axlrpro/file-integrity-manager): Used to detect any changes to files in a folder. Also detects newly created files and deleted files.
